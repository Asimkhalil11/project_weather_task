Vim editor used is very simple. when used vim editor,
first we are open terminal from Where we have to put the file,
and we write command vim and file name,
if this file already exists, So this file will open,
if this file dose not already exists, so open the new file,

i key for Insert 
esc key for skip
k,j,l,h key for top buttom right left
:wq for save and exit
:q! for not save and exit


nano also used same vim editor but this command is little bit different.
when we open nano editor we used comman on trminal nano then file name
than open the file and we text and we will do file save for this command "ctrl+x" and type y
